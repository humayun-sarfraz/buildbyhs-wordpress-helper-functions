## BuildByHS WordPress Helper Functions

This repository provides a collection of self-contained PHP helper functions designed to streamline common tasks in WordPress theme and plugin development. Each helper is maintained in its own file for easy inclusion, enabling you to pick and choose only the utilities you need.

Simply copy the desired helper into your project, include it in your functions.php or main plugin file, and call the function wherever required. Contributions and new helpers are welcome to make this toolkit even more versatile..
